# awesomeWM-utility

*I will update this page once I figure out what I'm doing.*

## Introduction (only a teaser, for now):

This is a hobby project of mine, which documents the attempt of converting the bare awesomeWM desktop into something useful (and hopefully, pretty). 

It also allows me to create something fun while learning Lua.

## Roadmap

**First project on the agenda:** unread email notifications through Gmail API.

## License:

MIT.
